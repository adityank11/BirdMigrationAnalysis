# BirdMigrationAnalysis
Bird migration analysis refers to the study of patterns, behaviors, and ecological factors associated with the movement of birds between different locations during their annual migratory journeys. It involves tracking and analyzing the routes, timing, distances, and stopover sites of migratory birds to understand their migration strategies, population dynamics, habitat preferences, and conservation needs. In this project, I built 4-5 models for predicting the coordinates of the next location of the bird. For my model building, model evaluation, and analysis: I used an open-source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of migration data of three seagulls: Eric, Nico and Sanne. The dataset contains columns like latitude, longitude, direction, altitude, speed_2d, bird_name and time stamps. The records for Eric, Nico, and Sanne are presented in the same sequence in the migration data. This dataset is a part of the LifeWatch INBO project. This bird migration dataset contains tracking data of seagulls for a period of 3 years.
